# inkyconv
## Convert any image to one pimoroni's inkyphat / inkywhat understands. ##
[https://github.com/pimoroni/inky](https://github.com/pimoroni/inky)

Intended for use on a Linux system with imagemagick installed.
Should in theory also work on Windows with imagemagick in the PATH.

Beware that it puts a temp file in the working directory.

This script is hardcoded for the red InkyPHAT. If you have another model, edit the color value, example file, and display dimensions to match your product version.
